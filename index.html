    <p id = "para">My hobby is reading. I like to read the book series of Malory Towers by Enid Blyton.
        This book series tells us about a girl named Darrell and how she got into a boarding school named Malory Towers.There are twelve books in this series.<br>
        I enjoy reading these books because they tell how it feels like to go to school. I have read two books from the series.<br> Enid Blyton has wriiten many good books for children and I recommend you should read her books too.</p>
